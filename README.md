# Blog
A content management system built with Slim 3 PHP framework. This content management system uses twig templating system and illuminate database for fast querying of results. The blog is very simple and simplicity is it's key. This was one of my first projects made with bootstrap and has gone through a lot of development since, it utilizes bootstrap 4 as of the moment.
